This is a *"little"* personal project that i wanna do,
wether I be in school, home, wherever.
**Might** make it into a "giant" (like 4 games at most) hub, idk

This is all open sourced, I don't like obfuscation. (random errors, killing my hooks, hella lag)

Drawing lib ui, it looks like **ass** (most of it at least). I've been debating over remaking it, theres a few versions, none of which finished (I stopped working on it or too much to rewrite.)
